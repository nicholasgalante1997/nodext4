2.1. Blocks

Source: https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/ext4/overview.html#blocks

ext4 allocates storage space in units of “blocks”. 
A block is a group of sectors between 1KiB and 64KiB, 
and the number of sectors must be an integral power of 2. 
Blocks are in turn grouped into larger units called block groups. 
Block size is specified at mkfs time and typically is 4KiB. 
You may experience mounting problems if block size is greater than page size 
(i.e. 64KiB blocks on a i386 which only has 4KiB memory pages). 
By default a filesystem can contain 2^32 blocks; 
if the ‘64bit’ feature is enabled, then a filesystem can have 2^64 blocks. 
The location of structures is stored in terms of the block number the structure lives in 
and not the absolute offset on disk.
